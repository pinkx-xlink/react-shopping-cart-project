# react-shopping-cart-project
React JS shopping cart project for The Odin Project. 


Game plan:
"Think about the component and the folder structure. How could you set up your application? Which components or functionalities do you need? Itâ€™s a good idea to note this down somewhere you can easily get to and refer back and add to it to keep track."


./Components
"Which comp do you need?"
/pages
  home.js
  shop.js
Navbar.js
Cards.js
CardItem.js
PageContent.js
Footer.js
Cart.js 
// Maybe DisplayCart.js & CartTotal.js

"Which functionalities do you need?"
-  display items
-  fetch item info, like price, image, alt text, description, etc.
-  add item to cart
-  get cart price total
-  add newest item price to cart total
-  switch from homepage to shop page
-  show shopping cart
-  close shopping cart
